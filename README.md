# Modified-SIR-Model

**Introduction**
This document the modified Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model for COVID-19, incorporating governmental prevention measures into the traditional SIR framework. This modification allows the model to account for varying levels of social restrictions, which are represented by a time-dependent coefficient. This enhancement aims to provide more accurate simulations of disease spread under different policy implementations, useful for public health planning and response evaluation.
